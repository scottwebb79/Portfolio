        <div><h4><b>Dashboard Module Concept Summary</b></h4>

            <section>
                 <div class="clearfix">
                     <img class="DashboardImage" src="Images/Dashboard.png" alt="Dashboard" height="300" width="450">
                            The dashboard module should provide the user with an overview of the proficency of his/her unit scope. If the
                            user  is a platoon sergeant who is in charge of twelve Marines, then the users dashboard will provide data and 
                            charts that represents the training of those twelve Marines.  The dashboard should be place where the user is
                            able to conduct quick analysis of training data and conduct training deficiency diagnostics. Although the
                            Dashboard does present data in a usable format, it will not be designed to go into depth concerning individual
                            training records. This should be done within reports. The Dashboard should be contain the units training 
                            readiness.

                             <li>| Top Three Marines |</li>
                             <li>| Top Three Deficiencies ||</li>
                         </ul>
                     </aside>
                </div>

      </div>
   </div>
          
       <div><h4><b>Reports</b></h4>
            <section>    <p>The reports module will allow the user to dive deeper into the database and allow for both common reports as
                            well as customizable reports. Again, the reports module will be restricted to the users scope. Common reports
                            consist of CMMR, Unit Roster, Individual crew position prerequisite requirements, Core Skill Proficiency and
                            Mission Skill Proficiency Reports.</p>
            </section>
        
        </div>
        <div><h4><b>Administration</b></h4>
            <section>    <p>Those users with administration privileges will have access for the entry of accomplished training within
                            their scope. The administration module will also allow tiered administrators to award certifications,
                            designations and qualifications. Under this module, personnel can be requested and forwarded to another unit,
                            or even deactivated (as to archieve).</p>
            </section>
        </div>
        <div><h4><b>Calendar</b></h4>
            <section>    <p> The calendar will allow commands and users alike to schedule training events. Additionally, they will be able
                             to review their calendars for events and be able to interact. Instructors will be able to approve events as 
                             well as leadership of the Marine who is requesting an event. Events such as exercises should be maintained 
                             here. Exercise events should be able to be associated with trainees, and that trainee (once complete) should 
                             be awarded the training event in their training record. This will be how training is entered into the 
                             database (at least one way).</p>
            </section>
        </div>
        <div><h4><b>Profile</b></h4>
            <section>    <p>The user profile should all the user to review information such as: the unit they are assigned, view their
                            scope, review and update their personal information, and even upload/update a profile picture. Within the
                            profile module, there will a chat application in which users will be able communicate with each other. This
                            chat will be logged. Additionally, this is where users will have access to readboards, best practices posts
                           (similar to a wiki), and allows the users to have somewhat of a social aspect to the information system. As 
                           users receive credentials, they will receive awards that can be viewed by all. Its a way for them to share 
                           their accomplishments with the community.</p>
            </section>
        </div>
        <div><h4><b>Help</b></h4>
            <section>    <p> The help module should contain both a help file and an index for quick reference. The help module should also 
                             provide intuitive "How To's" for all other modules and sub-modules. This will need to be maintained and 
                             updated regularly as the Information System evolves.</p>
